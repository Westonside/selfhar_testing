# Important Note
This project code is from https://github.com/iantangc/SelfHAR
# Running the code 
For this project I have streamline the feature extraction in the project and /feature_extraction/feature_extraction_running.py is the file to extract features
The run_selfhar code was used in the start of the project which is why it has been kept in and is commented to explain why each step occurs 
# Dependencies
Please ensure that you have pip installed the latest version of SensorBasedTransformerTorch as the implementation in feature_extraction requires the data loading functionality
Please not that the requirements in the requirements.txt file for the SensorBasedTransformerTorch project are for a absolute path, just make sure that you `pip install .` in the SensorBasedTransformerTorch directory
